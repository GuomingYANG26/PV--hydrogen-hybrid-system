# PV--hydrogen-hybrid-system
Code to reproduce the results of the work "***Title to be decided***."

# Requirement: 
If one wants to run the code in this Github repository, he/she needs to install the software of [Python(3.9.7)](https://www.python.org/), [Gurobi (9.5.1)](https://www.gurobi.com/), [Anaconda3](https://www.anaconda.com/). Besides, the installation of the Python packages at the top of each .py file is also a necessity. 

# Code:
A total of ***eight*** Python scripts is offered to ensure reproducibility. [data_download.py](https://github.com/GuomingYANG26/PV--hydrogen-hybrid-system/blob/master/data_download.py) is used to download the TMY data of the city with the specific longitude and latitude values; [contour_map.py](https://github.com/GuomingYANG26/PV--hydrogen-hybrid-system/blob/master/contour_map.py) draws the contour map (Fig.5 in the manuscript); [pvmodeling_model_chain.py](https://github.com/GuomingYANG26/PV--hydrogen-hybrid-system/blob/master/pvmodeling_model_chain.py) provides the PV power simulated from the physical solar power curve modeling; [pvmodeling_conventional.py](https://github.com/GuomingYANG26/PV--hydrogen-hybrid-system/blob/master/pvmodeling_conventional.py) simulates the PV power using conventional approach; The optimal equipment capacities and economics of the hybrid system can be acquired in [Photo_hydrogen_coupling.py](https://github.com/GuomingYANG26/PV--hydrogen-hybrid-system/blob/master/Photo_hydrogen_coupling.py), whereas the optimal results under the different level of government support is obtained via [Lambda_air_environmental.py](https://github.com/GuomingYANG26/PV--hydrogen-hybrid-system/blob/master/Lambda_air_environmental.py); [heilongjiang_tmy.py](https://github.com/GuomingYANG26/PV--hydrogen-hybrid-system/blob/master/heilongjiang_tmy.py) finds the tilt and azimuth angles of the inclined surface with the maximum capacity factor; [Heilongjiang_optimize.py](https://github.com/GuomingYANG26/PV--hydrogen-hybrid-system/blob/master/Heilongjiang_optimize.py) provides the optimization results in different cities of Heilongjiang Province.

As for the other results, one can manually modify the related parameters. 

# Data
There are ***six*** kinds of csv data. The file name is clear and one can easily know what content is included. In that, [2020_electriciy_price.csv](https://github.com/GuomingYANG26/PV--hydrogen-hybrid-system/blob/master/data/2020_electriciy_price.csv) provides the electricity prices; [harbin_tmy_data.csv](https://github.com/GuomingYANG26/PV--hydrogen-hybrid-system/blob/master/data/harbin_tmy_data.csv) contains the TMY data of Harbin city; [pv_module_chain.csv](https://github.com/GuomingYANG26/PV--hydrogen-hybrid-system/blob/master/data/pv_module_chain.csv) possess the PV power of the PV plant situated in Harbin simulated from model chain; [pv_tradional.csv](https://github.com/GuomingYANG26/PV--hydrogen-hybrid-system/blob/master/data/pv_tradional.csv) includes the PV power modeled from the conventional approach. The files with the name of "[XX_sapm_pv_modeling.csv](https://github.com/GuomingYANG26/PV--hydrogen-hybrid-system/tree/master/data/pv)" contain the PV power under the optimla inclination of the PV surface in different cities of Heilongjiang, whereas the files with the name of "[XX_tmy_data.csv](https://github.com/GuomingYANG26/PV--hydrogen-hybrid-system/tree/master/data/tmy)" contains the TMY data.
